"# DreamCatcher.AI Client\n+\n+This is the React/Vite frontend for DreamCatcher.AI. It delivers a responsive, RTL-aware experience that lets Hebrew-speaking users sign up, log in, journal dreams, and read AI-powered interpretations while keeping legal content consistent across dialogs and dedicated pages.\n+\n+## Stack highlights\n+- **Framework:** React 18 + Vite + TypeScript\n+- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom gradients, Framer Motion micro-interactions, and reusable RTL-ready components\n+- **State + data:** Zustand global store, TanStack Query for data loading/caching, hooks under `/src/hooks` for auth and dreams logic\n+- **Routing:** `react-router` with layout wrapper, privacy/terms pages, and a custom 404\n+- **Assets:** Localized illustrations, icons, SVG gradients, and brand imagery in `/src/assets`\n+\n+## Getting started\n+```bash\n+cd client\n+npm install\n+npm run dev      # starts Vite + HMR on http://localhost:5173\n+```\n+Ensure the frontend can reach the API (adjust `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` if necessary).\n+\n+## Environment variables (`client/.env`)\n+```\n+VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000\n+VITE_APP_NAME=DreamCatcher.AI\n+VITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n+```\n+Add optional keys (Sentry, analytics, etc.) only when they are configured for the environment.\n+\n+## NPM scripts\n+| Script | Purpose |\n+| --- | --- |\n+| `npm run dev` | Local development server (Vite). |\n+| `npm run build` | Production build output in `dist/`. |\n+| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build for a final sanity check. |\n+| `npm run lint` | ESLint + TypeScript validation. |\n+\n+## Production notes\n+- Always run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` before deploying. Fix all warnings/errors from ESLint and type-checking.\n+- Keep legal copy in `src/constants/terms.ts` so both dialogs and pages stay synchronized.\n+- Use router navigation (`Link` and `useNavigate`) instead of window/global redirects so the SPA history stack stays clean.\n+- Serve the built `dist/` folder behind a CDN or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with appropriate cache headers for assets.\n+\n+## Project layout\n+```\n+src/\n+  components/      # cards, form inputs, modals, legal dialogs, trends/dream widgets\n+  pages/           # Login, Register, Privacy, Terms, NotFound, Dream journal flow\n+  lib/             # API clients, hooks, utility helpers\n+  assets/          # images, logos, icons, gradients\n+  stores/           # Zustand stores for auth, dreams, ui state\n+  styles/           # Tailwind overrides, gradients, global classes\n+```\n+\n+## Recommended workflow\n+1. Install dependencies in both `client/` and `server_ai/`.\n+2. Run the frontend against the backend API by setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the Express base URL (default `http://localhost:3000`).\n+3. Use `npm run lint` and `npm run build` as gating steps for deployment.\n+4. Optionally add Storybook/E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) for flows like registration and dream sharing.\n+\n+This client code is production-ready, RTL-first, and designed for a confident DreamCatcher.AI rollout."
