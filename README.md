"# DreamCatcher.AI\n+\n+DreamCatcher.AI is a bilingual dream journaling and interpretation app that pairs a responsive React + Vite frontend with an Express/Mongoose backend and a lightweight AI/MCP layer. The product is built with RTL-ready styling, thoughtful routing, and reusable legal/UX components so Hebrew-speaking users can journal with confidence and explore their subconscious in a modern, production-quality experience.\n+\n+## What’s inside\n+- **client/** – React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS with Zustand state management, TanStack Query for data fetching, Framer Motion for micro-interactions, and i18n-ready layouts.\n+- **server_ai/** – Express API built with Node.js 20, MongoDB/Mongoose models, Zod validation, JWT auth, and integrations to OpenRouter/MCP for AI-driven dream analysis.\n+- **nginx/** – (Optional) proxy configuration to front the API and handle TLS/staging traffic when deploying behind a reverse proxy.\n+\n+## Production-ready principles\n+- **Typed APIs & validation** – all payloads pass through centralized Zod schemas to protect the database from malformed input.\n+- **Legal content is centralized** – terms and privacy text is sourced from shared constants so the same copy feeds the dialog and standalone screens, which reduces duplication and eases translations.\n+- **Router-friendly navigation** – links use `react-router` rather than direct `window` assignments, ensuring in-app navigation keeps the history stack clean.\n+- **Safety-first** – the UX explicitly surface Terms and Privacy links, breadcrumb-style navigation, and fallback 404 handling to prevent confused journeys.\n+- **Tests & linting** (suggested) – run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` within both `client/` and `server_ai/` before releasing; consider adding Playwright or Cypress E2E coverage once the flows stabilize.\n+\n+## Getting started\n+1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:\n+   ```bash\n+   git clone <repo>\n+   cd DreamCatcher.AI\n+   cd client && npm install\n+   cd ../server_ai && npm install\n+   ```\n+2. Copy the example environment files (if present) and supply production-safe secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, OpenRouter API keys, etc.).\n+3. Run both apps during development:\n+   - `npm run dev` inside `client/` (Vite dev server).\n+   - `npm run dev` or `npm start` inside `server_ai/` (Express).\n+4. Visit `http://localhost:5173` for the client and ensure it talks to the API (adjust proxy/settings in `client/vite.config.ts` if needed).\n+\n+## Directory overview\n+| Scope | Details |\n+| --- | --- |\n+| `client/` | UI, auth flows, dream feed, and legal dialogs; ships with RTL-friendly, dark-mode-aware components. |\n+| `server_ai/` | API routes, controllers, Mongoose models (`dream`, `user`), and AI orchestration for interpreting dreams. |\n+| `nginx/` | Optional configuration for Nginx reverse proxy or staging TLS setup. |\n+\n+## Recommended release checklist\n+1. Run linting and unit tests: `npm run lint` and `npm run test` inside each workspace.\n+2. Validate legal copy and privacy sections display the current content from `client/src/constants/terms.ts`.\n+3. Build optimized bundles: `npm run build` inside `client/` and `server_ai/`, then verify the server bundle runs against a staging database.\n+4. Deploy with a reverse proxy or CDN; ensure HTTPS, rate limiting, and CORS headers are configured for the API.\n+\n+## Documentation links\n+- `client/README.md` – frontend-specific notes (if present) with UX/growth info.\n+- `server_ai/README.md` – backend/AI deployment concepts and environment variable reference.\n+\n+---\n+DreamCatcher.AI is production-focused, multilingual, and ready for regulated dream journaling journeys. Let me know if you want a CI/CD checklist or deployment scripts next."
